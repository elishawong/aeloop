/**
 * Role → output-schema registry, kept **outside** `composer.ts` (Zorro
 * review, feature/issue-1-a0-a1-scaffold): the prior implementation defined
 * `OUTPUT_SCHEMAS = { coder: CoderOutput, tester: TesterOutput }` as a
 * private constant inside `composer.ts` itself — that's the exact "硬编码
 * {coder,tester}" shape DESIGN §1.7 calls out for *personas* ("不用 Verity
 * 那个硬编码 {coder,tester} Record"), just repeated one layer over for
 * schemas. Registering a new role's schema now means building a
 * `SchemaRegistry` object at the call site (e.g. `{
 * ...DEFAULT_OUTPUT_SCHEMAS, reviewer: ReviewerOutput }`) and passing it
 * into `PromptComposer`'s constructor — never editing this file or
 * `composer.ts`.
 *
 * A registry entry is `z.ZodType | null`, not just `z.ZodType | undefined`
 * (absent key): `null` is an *explicit* "this role deliberately has no
 * structured output schema" registration (e.g. a free-text "reviewer"
 * role), distinct from "this role was never registered at all" (a missing
 * key). `PromptComposer.compose()` throws `SchemaNotRegisteredError` for
 * the latter — an unregistered role is very likely a caller mistake (a new
 * role added to `personas/` whose schema wiring was simply forgotten), and
 * the previous silent-omit behavior is exactly what let that mistake pass
 * unnoticed (PRD §5 / Zorro review: "未知角色静默丢契约").
