 * `LOOP_NODES`/`GATE_TYPES` — the single naming source for every node name /
 * gate-type string literal used anywhere under `src/loop/` (PRD §5
 * "workflow-def.ts"). `types.ts`/`graph.ts`/`gates.ts`/`nodes/*.ts` all
 * `import { LOOP_NODES, GATE_TYPES } from "./workflow-def.js"` rather than
 * hand-writing the same string literal in more than one place — the spike
 * scripts (docs/feature/a4a-loop/spike/q2-q5) wrote node names as bare
 * string literals scattered across each file, which is fine for a
 * throwaway spike but would be a real footgun in production code (typo a
 * node name in one call site, `tsc` won't catch it because there's nothing
 * to check it against).
 *
 * `CODER_TESTER_LOOP_DEFINITION` is a **documentation** artifact, not a
 * runtime-interpreted config `graph.ts` reads (PRD §5's explicit, detailed
 * downgrade from DESIGN §6's "graph.ts 编译自 WorkflowDefinition" — see the
 * PRD section for the full reasoning: LangGraph's TS API is built around
 * compile-time literal node names / `Annotation` state shapes, and none of
 * spike Q2-Q5 exercised "build a StateGraph at runtime from a data
 * structure"). `graph.ts`'s actual `addNode`/`addEdge`/`addConditionalEdges`
 * calls are hand-written, but every string literal they use is imported
 * from `LOOP_NODES`/`GATE_TYPES` below, so a typo becomes a `tsc` error
 * instead of a silent divergence between "what this file describes" and
 * "what graph.ts actually builds". `workflows/coder-tester-loop.json`
 * (DESIGN §6) is deliberately **not created** by this PRD — see PRD §5 for
 * why a file that looks consumed but isn't would be worse than no file at
 * all.
