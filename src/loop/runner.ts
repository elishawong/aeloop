/**
 * `startRun()`/`resumeRun()` — the business-orchestration layer above
 * `graph.ts` (A4b PRD §5 "runner.ts"). This is the **only** file that
 * simultaneously holds both "graph deps" (`router`/`composer`) and "audit
 * deps" (`AuditStore`/`BaseCheckpointSaver`) — every graph node/gate under
 * `src/loop/` continues to know nothing about `AuditStore` (PRD §8's "graph
 * nodes/gates continue to maintain zero I/O purity" acceptance criterion;
 * `grep -rn
 * "better-sqlite3\|Database(" src/loop/gates.ts src/loop/escalation.ts
 * src/loop/graph.ts src/loop/nodes` must stay empty).
 *
 * **How this file attributes new audit rows to the right node/round**
 * (the mechanism PRD §5's "diff the state before/after invoke, and persist
 * whatever newly appears...into approvals/structured_claims" describes, at
 * the level of precision build
 * had to work out): `compiled.stream(input, {...cfg, streamMode:
 * "updates"})` — verified empirically against this repo's real
 * `buildLoopGraph()`/`compileLoopGraph()` output before writing this file
 * — yields one chunk per node that actually *completes* during this call,
 * shaped `{ [nodeName]: partialStateUpdate }`, plus a final `{
 * __interrupt__: [...] }` chunk when the graph pauses. This is a precise,
 * per-node-execution trace — the right mechanism for "did draft/review
 * really run again this round", not identity/content diffing of
 * `coderOutput`/`testerOutput` across two `getState()` snapshots (which
 * are freshly deserialized on every call and therefore never
 * reference-equal even when unchanged, and which can coincide in *content*
 * across rounds for a deterministic adapter — either pitfall would have
 * silently mis-attributed claims to the wrong round, or dropped them).
 * `invoke()` is never used in this file for that reason.
 *
 * **`step_ref`'s per-node counters are threaded through `RunHandle` *and*
 * rebuilt from disk on every `resumeRun()` call** (PRD §4.2: "this counter
 * only lives in runner.ts's runtime variable, it isn't persisted as part
 * of LoopState" — still
 * true, `stepCounters` itself is never persisted as its own column/table —
 * but the *authoritative starting point* for a resume is no longer only
 * whatever in-memory value the caller happens to hand back).
 *
 * **Review Round-1 D1 rework** (`docs/feature/a4b-loop/test-report.md`):
 * this used to trust the caller-supplied `stepCounters` param alone,
 * defaulting to `{}`. That was fine for a same-process resume where the
 * caller always threads the previous call's returned `stepCounters`
 * forward, but silently wrong the moment it wasn't — a resume landing in a
 * *new* process (no in-memory `RunHandle` to inherit), or simply a caller
 * that forgot to thread it — started every node's counter back at `{}`.
 * If that resume then revisited an already-visited node (e.g. a second
 * `draft` round after a G2 loop-back), the freshly-restarted counter would
 * re-mint a `step_ref` already on disk from an earlier round (`draft#1`
 * again, not `draft#2`), silently colliding.
 *
 * **Fix**: `resumeRun()` now calls `AuditStore.listStepRefsByRun(runId)`
 * and rebuilds each node's counter as the max `#n` suffix already on disk
 * for that run (`rebuildStepCounters()` below), then merges that with
 * whatever the caller supplied (`mergeStepCounters()`, element-wise max) —
 * the DB read makes a brand-new process's resume just as collision-safe as
 * a same-process one, and the merge means a caller that *does* still have
 * a fresher in-memory value (mid-flight within the same call, before this
 * round's own writes have landed on disk yet) never regresses below it.
 * `startRun()` doesn't need this — a brand-new run has no prior rows to
 * rebuild from, so its counters correctly start at `{}`.
 *
 * **Review Round-2 R2-2 addendum** (`docs/feature/a4b-loop/test-report.md`):
 * D1's disk-rebuild only works if every round actually leaves a row for
 * `AuditStore.listStepRefsByRun()` to find. A round whose `claims` array is
 * empty (legal per `prompt/schema.ts` — no `.min(1)`) used to leave *no*
 * row at all, so the D1 bug this file's header above already describes
 * could still happen via a different trigger: "no claims this round"
 * instead of "no in-memory counter this process". Fixed by writing an
 * unconditional `AuditStore.insertStepMarker()` row for every draft/review
 * round (see the claims-persistence block below), inside the same
 * transaction as that round's claims — `rebuildStepCounters()` itself
 * needed no change, it already trusts whatever `listStepRefsByRun()`
 * returns.

 * finished. `structured_claims`/`approvals` rows, by contrast, are written
 * incrementally, per chunk, as each node actually completes. A node that
 * throws mid-execution (a real adapter failure — e.g. the tester adapter
 * being unavailable — needs no illegal input and no concurrency) makes the
 * `for await` loop itself throw, propagating straight out of this function
 * and skipping the trailing sync entirely. LangGraph's own checkpoint, in
 * contrast, is persisted incrementally as each node completes — so a claim/
 * approval already landed (and the checkpoint already advanced past the
 * node that produced it) while `workflow_runs.current_state` stayed
 * wherever it was *before* this call started, a permanent split between
 * the checkpoint (the graph's real position) and the business ledger this
 * product's audit trail is supposed to make legible. Manual reproduction:
 * G1 approve succeeds (an `approvals` row lands, checkpoint
 * advances past G1 into `review`), the tester adapter throws inside
 * `review` before that node can produce a chunk — `approvals` shows
 * `g1#1/approved`, the checkpoint's `next` is `["review"]`, but
 * `workflow_runs` was still reading `current_state="g1"` forever, because
 * nothing had told it otherwise. Fixed by calling `computeRunProgress()`
 * (and writing its patch via `audit.updateRunProgress`) after *every*
 * chunk this loop finishes processing, not only once after the loop ends —
 * so if a later node throws before yielding its own chunk, `workflow_runs`
 * already reflects the last chunk that *did* land, matching the
 * checkpoint's real position instead of lagging behind it. The loop's
 * final iteration already covers the "stream completed normally" case, so
 * nothing calls `computeRunProgress()` a second time for that path; the

/**
 * Resumes an existing run. **Requires nothing but `runId`/`threadId` plus a
 * freshly-constructed `checkpointer` pointed at the same on-disk file** —
 * no in-memory reference to anything `startRun()` (or a previous
 * `resumeRun()`) produced is read here (`stepCounters` is accepted as a
 * plain, caller-supplied value, not implicitly captured from a closure).
 * This is what "production-grade cross-process resume" concretely means
 * for this file (A4b PRD §5 runner.ts: "this function doesn't require the
 * caller to hold any in-memory object reference from startRun()").
 *
 * **Review Round-1 B2 rework** (`docs/feature/a4b-loop/test-report.md`):
 * `runId` and `threadId` used to be trusted as an already-matching pair —
 * `threadId` drove the graph, `runId` alone drove every audit write, with
 * nothing checking the two actually named the same run. A caller that
 * mismatched them (e.g. run A's `runId` with run B's `threadId`) would
 * silently advance B's graph while attributing B's claims/approvals/
 * `reject_count` to A's audit trail. This now looks up `runId`'s real
 * `langgraphThreadId` via `AuditStore.getRunById` *before* touching the
 * graph or writing anything, and throws `RunThreadMismatchError` on any
 * mismatch (fail loud, zero writes) rather than ever reaching a single
 * `audit.insert*` call with an unverified pair.
 *
 * **Review Round-2 R2-5 rework** (`docs/feature/a4b-loop/test-report.md`):
 * a `decidedBy` guard used to live only inside `runStreamAndPersist`'s
 * per-chunk loop (still there below, as a backstop for any other caller of
 * that shared helper) — which only fires *after* `compiled.stream()` has
 * already advanced the graph/checkpoint past whichever gate produced this
 * call's decision. `decidedBy: string` is non-optional in this function's
 * own type signature, so every real TS call site is statically required to
 * supply one; the only way to reach a runtime-invalid value here at all is
 * a caller bypassing that type at runtime. But *if* that happens, the old
 * ordering meant the checkpoint had already moved on while
 * `workflow_runs`/`approvals` never got the corresponding write — an
 * inconsistent state, not just a thrown error. Checked here first, before
 * `getRunById`/the graph/anything else, so a runtime-invalid `decidedBy`
 * now fails loud before touching the checkpoint or the DB at all.
 *
 * **Review Round-3 R3-2 rework** (`docs/feature/a4b-loop/test-report.md`):
 * this guard (and its `runStreamAndPersist` backstop) originally checked
 * only `decidedBy === undefined`, which caught a bypassing caller that
 * passed `undefined` but not one that passed `null` (`null !== undefined`
 * sails past both checks, the graph advances, and the write only fails
 * later — loudly, but after the checkpoint already moved — at
 * `decided_by TEXT NOT NULL`, audit-store.ts). Both guards now check
 * `typeof decidedBy !== "string"`, which rejects `null` and any other
 * non-string value the same way they already rejected `undefined`.
 *
 * **Review Round-4 R5-B1 rework** (`docs/feature/a4b-loop/test-report.md`):
 * `resume`'s parameter type, `GateResumeValue | EscalationResumeValue`, is
 * an **undiscriminated** union — nothing here used to check that the
 * `resume` value's decision domain actually matched the gate the run was
 * paused at. A caller could hand a `{decision: "force_pass"}`
 * (`EscalationResumeValue`, no cast required — TS-legal on its own) to a
 * run paused at **G1**, which only understands `GateResumeValue`. That
 * used to insert an illegitimate `approvals` row first, then fail loud
 * only once `routeAfterG1`'s own `default: throw` ran — by which point the
 * checkpoint had already advanced past G1 while `workflow_runs` hadn't,
 * a split state, plus a spurious audit row. Now checked immediately after
 * the B2 threadId/runId guard above (same "before touching the graph or
 * writing anything" ordering) via `resumeDecisionsFor(run.currentState)`,
 * throwing `ResumeDecisionDomainMismatchError` (zero writes) on a mismatch.
 *
 * **Review Round-5 R6-B1 rework** (`docs/feature/a4b-loop/test-report.md`):
 * the R5-B1 guard above closed the *cross-domain* case (an Escalation-shaped
 * value reaching a g1/g2/g3 gate, or vice versa) but `resumeDecisionsFor()`
 * still mapped all three gates to one shared three-value
 * `["approved","rejected","escalate"]` domain — three *same-domain* values
 * each gate's own `routeAfter*` router doesn't actually accept
 * (`{decision:"escalate"}` to G1 or G3, `{decision:"rejected"}` to G2)
 * still needed no cast and still reproduced R5-B1's exact failure class
 * (illegitimate `approvals` row landed first, gate router's own
 * `default`/`UnhandledGateDecisionError` threw second, checkpoint/
 * `workflow_runs` split). `resumeDecisionsFor()` now maps each gate to its
 * own real accepted set (see its doc comment above) instead of one shared
 * one, so all three of those paths are caught here too, before anything is
 * written.
